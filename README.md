## Overview of Project
This project was designed to help Louise uncover trends from past campaigns. Specifically; Louise wanted insights to uncover past successful, failed and canceled outcomes that ranged from monetary goals of less than $1000 to over $50,000 from plays.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
From the Kickstarter worsheet, a filtered research of campaigns with goals ranging from under $1000 to greater than $50,000 was analyzed. The analysis was further specified for the number and percentage of each successful, failed, and canceled plays. In the new sheet, the sum of each successful, failed and canceled play was also calculated followed by a line graph to display the results. I followed the video located under the 'Hint' tab for the module 1 challenge. From there, I followed the correct formula to fill in each column.
### Challenges
I came over a few challenges during the completion of this assignment. I'm not sure where the error occured in my workbook, but I was unable to fill in the 'canceled' portion of data. I believe that along the way in completing this module, my numbers in the workbook somehow became distorted and I was unable to retreive the original data.
### Results
Two conclusions that I can draw from the Theater Outcomes by Launch date are that the months of May and June had the highest number of suucessful theater outcomes and that the month of December almost had the same amount of successful and failed outcomes.
For outcomes based on goals, there were way more camplaigns that had goals of under $1000 than any other monetary ranges. Some limitations of this dataset is that it is only focusing on one subcategory of the theater genre and not considering other consumers' prefrence for other generes such as musicals and film. This may have had an impact on whether goals were met and successful or not. A pie chart could have also been used to display the huge difference betweem successful and failed campaign goals.
